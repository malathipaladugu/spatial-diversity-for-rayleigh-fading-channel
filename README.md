spatial diversity-for-rayleigh-fading-channel
-------------------------------------------------

Implemented M-QAM and M-PSK modulation schemes over AWGN and Rayleigh flat fading channels
spatial diversity concepts are applied to mitigate channel effects, which lead to performance improvement in slow Rayleigh flat fading SIMO channel.
SER vs SNR is observed using  diversity schemes, maximum ratio combining, equal gain combining, selection combining was found
